exercise_names 
    name "BB Bench Press"
    users
        userid1 'exercise_id'
        userid2 'exercise_id'

when I get an exercise we check if
the exercise name exists 
if it exists we check if the exercise has the user
if it does then we get the exercise id's from the user 
then we get the exercise id's and sort by date
then get the most recent exercise 
this should be the exercise that we want  

when I add an exercise we 
first add to the exericse database then we
check if the exercise name exists 
if not we add the exercise name
if it exists we check if the exercise has the user
we add the user and exercise id

need the exercises
need the reps and sets
and the weight calculated on their % but my max
